# react-board-games
A starter template for people wanting to build a board game with React.

## Overview
This is a React Typescript template for building simple board games. It does not use any libraries save from vanilla React components, but you can expand where needed. This is meant to be a template and thus basic functionality for creating a board game is included like board generation/loading and the ability to add position events.
